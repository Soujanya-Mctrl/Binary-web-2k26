  "problemStatement": "Women’s safety remains a critical concern, with most existing safety apps focusing on post-incident reporting rather than prevention. However, waiting for an incident to occur before taking action is not enough. Our challenge is to develop an AI-driven safety solution that proactively analyzes real-time location data, identifies high-risk areas, and alerts users before they enter potentially unsafe zones.\r\n\r\nBy integrating machine learning, crowd-sourced data, and historical crime records, this solution will empower individuals—especially women—to make informed decisions about their surroundings. How can we leverage AI and real-time data to shift from reactive safety measures to proactive prevention?",
  "solutionApproach": "Women’s safety is a critical issue. Most existing safety apps focus on incident reporting, but our approach is preventive—we use AI to analyze location risk before someone enters a potentially unsafe area.\r\n\r\nGuardian Angel is powered by XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting), a robust ML algorithm optimized for structured data. Our training dataset includes five crucial parameters:\r\n\r\nHuman Density: Evaluates crowd levels, as isolated areas may be unsafe.\r\n\r\nPolice Presence: More law enforcement increases safety.\r\n\r\nResidential Areas: More housing often means a safer environment.\r\n\r\nLighting Conditions: Poor lighting correlates with higher crime rates.\r\n\r\nCrime History: Past incidents help predict future risk levels.\r\n\r\nOur ML model is trained for high accuracy",

  "problemStatement": "In the logistics and shipping industry, damage to goods during transit results in over $35 billion in annual losses due to:\r\n\r\nLack of Real-Time Monitoring: Reliance on manual inspections leads to undetected damages.\r\n\r\nHigh Damage Claims: Frequent damage claims increase insurance costs and reduce profitability.\r\n\r\nInadequate Liability Data: Absence of real-time data on environmental conditions and impacts complicates liability assessments.\r\n\r\nCold Chain Management Issues: Failures in maintaining temperature-sensitive products can lead to spoilage.\r\n\r\nNo Location Tracking: Difficulty in pinpointing shipment locations hampers recovery efforts.\r\n\r\nObjective\r\nTo address these challenges, we propose a Smart Transit Damage Detection System utilizing an ESP32 microcontroller, MPU9250, DHT11 sensors, and GPS technology. This system will enable real-time monitoring of impacts, environmental conditions, and shipment locations, ultimately reducing damage, improving liability assessments.",
  "solutionApproach": "The Smart Package Monitoring System leverages a combination of IoT technology, sensors, and cloud services to monitor the condition of packages during transit. Here’s a detailed breakdown of the solution approach:\r\n\r\n1. System Architecture\r\nComponents:\r\n\r\nESP32 Microcontroller: Acts as the central unit for data collection and transmission.\r\n\r\nSensors:\r\n\r\nMPU9250: Measures impact forces and detects tilting of packages.\r\n\r\nDHT11: Monitors temperature and humidity levels inside the package.\r\n\r\nGPS Module: Provides real-time location tracking of shipments.\r\n\r\nCloud Integration: Data is transmitted to a Backend as a Service (BaaS) like Firebase for storage, processing, and real-time alerts.\r\n\r\n2. Data Collection\r\nThe ESP32 collects data from the sensors at regular intervals:\r\n\r\nImpact Data: Captured by the MPU9250 to detect shocks and tilts.\r\n\r\nEnvironmental Data: Temperature and humidity levels monitored by the DHT11.\r\n\r\nLocation Data: GPS provides coordinates for tracking shipment routes.\r\n\r\n3. Data Transmission\r\nThe collected data is sent securely to the cloud via Wi-Fi using HTTPS encryption. This ensures that sensitive information is protected during transmission.\r\n\r\n4. Real-Time Monitoring and Alerts\r\nThe system processes incoming data to identify any anomalies:\r\n\r\nIf impact exceeds a predefined threshold (e.g., >2g), or if temperature/humidity levels fall outside acceptable ranges, alerts are triggered.\r\n\r\nUsers receive notifications through a web or mobile application, allowing for immediate action to be taken.\r\n\r\n5. Data Analysis and Reporting\r\nThe cloud service stores historical data for analysis:\r\n\r\nUsers can access dashboards displaying trends in impact, temperature, humidity, and location over time.\r\n\r\nDetailed reports can be generated to assess damage incidents, aiding in liability determination and insurance claims.\r\n\r\n6. User Interface\r\nA user-friendly interface allows logistics personnel to:\r\n\r\nMonitor real-time conditions of shipments.\r\n\r\nView alerts and historical data logs.\r\n\r\nConfigure alert thresholds based on specific needs.\r\n\r\n7. Future Enhancements\r\nPotential upgrades could include:\r\n\r\nIntegration of machine learning algorithms for predictive analytics based on historical damage data.\r\n\r\nEnhanced GPS features for geofencing capabilities to monitor shipments entering or leaving designated areas.\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\nThis solution approach combines state-of-the-art IoT technology with real-time monitoring capabilities to significantly reduce transit damage risks. By providing actionable insights and alerts, the Smart Transit Damage Detection System enhances supply chain efficiency, improves liability assessments, and ultimately protects valuable assets during shipping.",

Complex code makes vulnerability detection challenging, increasing the likelihood of severe security breaches going unnoticed and unresolved. Additionally, intricate code structures complicate debugging, reduce code readability, and hinder timely maintenance efforts. Consequently, developers face difficulties in accurately identifying and addressing vulnerabilities and errors in highly complex code, emphasizing the need for effective complexity detection, quantification, and reduction strategies.",
  "solutionApproach": "To address high complexity leading to errors and vulnerabilities in software functions, the project proposes a multi-layered solution integrating Artificial Intelligence and Computational Intelligence techniques:\r\n\r\n1. Custom Complexity Scoring System:\r\n- Develop a proprietary pointing system to assign complexity scores to each individual line of code.  \r\n- Scores will reflect complexity, potential risk of error introduction, and vulnerability exposure clearly, helping developers immediately identify problematic lines.\r\n\r\n2. Vulnerability-Driven Complexity Analysis: \r\n- Correlate the custom complexity scores with known security vulnerability patterns and error-prone coding practices.  \r\n- Identify and prioritize code lines and functions posing the greatest security threats or error risks.\r\n\r\n3. Intelligent Refactoring with AI (Llama3.1):\r\n- Utilize the generative capabilities of the Llama3.1 model, specifically fine-tuned for secure coding standards, to automatically generate simplified alternatives for high-scoring complex lines and functions.  \r\n- Ensure refactored code retains original functionality while significantly lowering complexity scores and vulnerability exposure.\r\n\r\n4. Interactive IDE Integration: \r\n- Integrate complexity scores and vulnerability details seamlessly into development environments (e.g., VS Code extensions), enabling developers to easily visualize risks at the line-of-code level.  \r\n- Provide developers with AI-generated refactoring suggestions and allow manual review and approval, ensuring transparency and developer control.\r\n",

  "problemStatement": "In a new town or location, finding reliable workers for household or professional services can be challenging due to a lack of local knowledge and trusted recommendations. Our solution is a direct booking platform that connects users with nearby skilled workers based on location and user reviews, eliminating intermediaries. The platform ensures transparency, efficiency, and ease of access to services.",
  "solutionApproach": "Our platform aims to seamlessly connect users with skilled workers in their locality without intermediaries. Users and workers can create accounts with a secure authentication system using email and password, protected by JWT. Workers set up profiles by listing their skills, service categories, availability, pricing, and necessary documents, stored via Cloudinary. Users, on the other hand, can set location preferences and track their booking history.  \r\n\r\nTo help users find the right professionals, the platform employs a location-based discovery system, fetching nearby workers through geolocation APIs. Listings prioritize top-rated workers based on user reviews, with filters available for skills, experience, availability, and pricing. Once a suitable worker is found, users can directly book their services through the website. A built-in chat system facilitates communication, ensuring smooth coordination between both parties.  \r\n\r\nPost-service, users can provide ratings and reviews, contributing to a worker’s overall reputation score, which is based on factors like feedback, completion rate, and reliability. While the platform currently focuses on service booking and connections, secure payment integration is a potential future enhancement.  \r\n\r\nThe tech stack comprises React.js for the frontend, while Node.js and Express.js handle backend operations. MongoDB, with Mongoose for schema management, serves as the database. Authentication is managed through JWT, and Cloudinary is used for image storage. Development and testing tools like Postman and Nodemon ensure a smooth and efficient workflow. This streamlined approach guarantees a user-friendly, secure, and scalable solution for connecting users with trusted local workers.",

As a result, recyclable materials end up in landfills, organic waste gets mixed with plastics, and cities struggle with inefficient waste collection.\r\nThe challenge is simple: how do we make waste disposal smarter, easier, and rewarding for people?",
  "solutionApproach": "Step 1: Smart Waste Scanning\r\nInstead of guessing where your trash belongs, just scan it! Using GPT-4, our system instantly analyzes the waste and tells you the category of the waste like whether it is Plastic bag, Recycle water bottle, E-waste etc.  \r\n\r\nStep 2: Earn Points for Proper Disposal  \r\nEach time you scan and dispose of waste correctly, you earn points. The cleaner you keep the environment, the more rewards you get. It’s like a loyalty program—but for the planet!  \r\n\r\nStep 3: Track Your Impact \r\nYour personal dashboard shows your total contributions, points earned, and even ranks you among other eco-warriors. Compete with friends, level up, and become a sustainability champion!  \r\n\r\nStep 4: QR-Enabled Smart Dustbins (Future Upgrade)  \r\nImagine scanning a QR code on a dustbin and instantly knowing if it's the right one for your waste. This upgrade will allow cities to track waste collection hotspots and optimize recycling efforts.  \r\n\r\nStep 5: Community & Rewards  \r\nWhat’s better than saving the planet? Getting rewarded for it! Users can redeem their points for discounts, eco-friendly products, or even donate them for environmental causes.  \r\n\r\nWhy It Works\r\nEasy & Fun: No more confusion—just scan, toss, and earn.  \r\nIncentivized Behavior: People love rewards, and this system makes sustainability rewarding.  \r\nSmarter Cities: QR tracking helps improve waste collection efficiency.  \r\nCommunity-Driven: Leaderboards, challenges, and milestones keep people engaged.",

  "problemStatement": "Building a multilingual React application is a complex and time-consuming process. Developers typically need to manually extract text, maintain multiple language files, and integrate external translation services. This not only adds overhead but also introduces challenges such as:  \r\n\r\n- Keeping translations consistent across different languages  \r\n- Updating translations when the application content changes  \r\n- Managing large translation files as the project scales  \r\n- Relying on third-party APIs that may introduce latency and cost  \r\n\r\nThese challenges slow down development and make localization a tedious task. There is a need for a solution that automates the translation process without requiring developers to manually manage translations.",
  "solutionApproach": "\r\nOur Solution - AI-Powered Auto-Translation WrapTalk automates the entire translation workflow using AI. Developers only need to wrap their text with the <TranslateThis> component, provide a unique tid (translation ID), and run a simple CLI command to extract and translate text automatically. This eliminates the need for manual translation management and streamlines multilingual support in React apps. How It Works Installation & Setup Install the CLI globally: npm install -g wraptalk-cli Run initialization: npx wraptalk init This creates configuration files and installs the React component library Wrap Text in <TranslateThis> tsxCopy<TranslateThis tid=\"welcome_message\">Welcome to WrapTalk!</TranslateThis> The tid ensures each translation entry is unique This text will be automatically detected and translated Run the CLI to Manage Translations shCopynpx wraptalk run The CLI scans your project using AST analysis It extracts all <TranslateThis> components AI generates translations for multiple languages Translations are stored in structured JSON files Translation Storage Format jsonCopy{ \"english\": { \"welcome_message\": \"Welcome to WrapTalk!\" }, \"bengali\": { \"welcome_message\": \"WrapTalk-এ স্বাগতম!\" }, \"hindi\": { \"welcome_message\": \"WrapTalk में आपका स्वागत है!\" } } Stored locally in wraptalk.translations.json No API calls required at runtime Dynamically Switch Languages tsxCopyconst { setLanguage } = useLanguage(); <button onClick={() => setLanguage(\"bengali\")}>বাংলা</button> <button onClick={() => setLanguage(\"english\")}>English</button> The UI updates instantly based on the selected language Key Features Automated Translations - No manual translation work Easy Integration - Just wrap text in <TranslateThis> Fast Language Switching - useLanguage updates the UI dynamically No API Calls at Runtime - Translations are stored locally Improves Development Speed - Eliminates tedious translation management WrapTalk makes multilingual support seamless in React applications!RetryClaude does not have the ability to run the code it generates yet.Claude can make mistakes.

  "problemStatement": "Every day, thousands of local businesses struggle to be found online, while right around the corner, customers are searching for exactly what these shops offer. This disconnect is costing our communities.\r\n\r\nSmall business owners - from corner shops to street vendors - lack the technical skills and resources to create an online presence. 67% of them remain invisible online despite being physically close to potential customers.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, consumers face two major challenges: When they're in their own neighborhoods, they can't easily discover local hidden gems. And when traveling to unfamiliar areas, they struggle even more - often resorting to chain stores because they simply don't know where to find local options.\r\n\r\nThe result? Money leaves our neighborhoods, local businesses struggle, and customers miss out on unique local offerings that could be just around the corner - whether they're at home or exploring somewhere new",

Even street vendors can join and update their offerings through WhatsApp, voice messages, or our simple app.\r\n\r\nBy connecting neighbours with local businesses and helping travelers discover authentic local offerings, MohallaMart creates stronger communities where money stays in the local economy rather than flowing to distant corporations.",

  "problemStatement": "We offer a robust, AI-powered backend service that seamlessly integrates with platforms like Instagram or YouTube to detect deepfakes in user-uploaded videos. Upon receiving a video link (e.g., from Cloudinary), our FastAPI service downloads the file, runs inference through a state-of-the-art model, and returns a concise “fake” or “real” verdict. The system also stores user feedback to continuously refine detection accuracy, ensuring each new upload benefits from ongoing model improvements.",
  "solutionApproach": "Our solution is a backend service that integrates with platforms like Instagram and YouTube to verify video authenticity in real time. When a video is uploaded, our API receives the video URL or file and immediately downloads it. The system then extracts exactly eight evenly spaced frames from the video, resizing and normalizing them to create a consistent input tensor of shape (8, 224, 224, 3). This preprocessing ensures that every video is analyzed under the same conditions, allowing for efficient and standardized deepfake detection.\r\n\r\nFor spatial feature extraction, we employ a lightweight MobileNetV2 pre-trained on ImageNet, applied to each frame using TimeDistributed layers. The extracted spatial features are fed into an LSTM layer that captures the temporal dynamics across the eight frames, enabling the model to understand sequential context and subtle visual cues that indicate manipulation. Regularization techniques such as BatchNormalization, Dropout, and L2 regularization are applied throughout the network to prevent overfitting, resulting in a robust CNN-LSTM architecture that accurately classifies videos as authentic or deepfakes.\r\n\r\nOnce the video is processed, the platform displays it in the user’s feed alongside the detection results. Users see the video with a badge or indicator that reflects the model’s verdict (e.g., “Model: Authentic” or “Model: Potential Deepfake”). Additionally, the feed shows aggregated community opinions and provides an interactive interface where users can leave feedback on the authenticity judgment. This multi-faceted display not only informs users about the model’s decision but also fosters community engagement and trust by allowing users to contribute their perspective on the video’s legitimacy.",
